<h1>
  30 days journey of Android App development 
</h1>
<p>
  This repository documents my learning journey in Android App Development using Kotlin with the traditional XML-based UI approach.
  The goal of this journey is to build a strong foundation in Android development by understanding core concepts, UI design with XML, and app logic using Kotlin.
  That makes my core strong in app development.<br>

  Day 01
</h1>
<P>
  On the first day of my app development journey, I created a Toast Message app using a <b>LinearLayout</b> with<b>two buttons</b>  and implemented their logic in Kotlin.<br> 
<b>Goal:</b>
  The goal of making this app is to learn new concepts in my app development journey over 30 days.<br>
<b>Status:</b>
  Successfully completed my first app and posted it on GitHub to showcase my progress to the world 🌏.<br>

  Day 02
</h1>
<P>
 Today is the second day of my 30-day app development journey, and it is even more fun. Today’s topic is a<b>Theme Change App</b> , which gives my app a better look with some crazy color combinations.<br>
<b>Goal:</b>
 To build an app that can change themes to make the app more attractive and beautiful. However, the color combinations I used made it look a bit crazy 😄.<br>
<b>Status:</b>
 I made some mistakes that I don’t fully understand yet because this is only my second day. This happened because I did not use proper Android themes; instead, I applied the changes manually,
which caused some confusion.<br>
</P>
<h1>
  Day 03
</h1>
<p>
  Today is another day of exploring my Android app development journey. Today’s topic is collecting user information by creating an activity that includes basic UI components such as TextViews, plain text fields,
  password fields, postal address fields, an EditText to get the user’s date of birth using a DatePicker with the help of Kotlin, a field for state selection, and a Submit button to save all the data. 
  Below the Submit button, a TextView is added to display the output.<br>
<b>  Goal:</b>
 The main goal today was to create a sign-in form for collecting user information.
<b>Status:</b>
 The app was successfully completed, but I am not fully satisfied because the UI looks messy. I also did not experiment much with colors, which makes the app look a bit dull.<br>
</p>
<h1>
  DAY 04
</h1>
<p>
  Next day of my app development journey. Today’s topic is showing a welcome message using Intents. In this app, there are two activities. The first activity contains a LinearLayout with UI components, 
  including a plain text field to get the user’s name and a button to send this data to another activity using an explicit intent. The second activity also uses a LinearLayout and contains a TextView
  to display a simple welcome message such as “Hello!” followed by the user’s name. I also experimented with more colors today. They are not too bad, but not very good either.<br>
<b>Goal:</b>
 The main goal today was to clearly understand the concept of intents.<br>
<b>Status:</b>
 Successfully completed and conquered one more concept in my app development journey.<br>
